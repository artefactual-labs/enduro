  How do we release Enduro.
---

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions.\
See [`release.yml`][release-workflow] for more - we plan to develop it further.

The artifacts associated with a release are automatically published after the
git tag is submitted to the repository. We use annotated tags. For example:

    git tag -a "v0.20.0" -m "Enduro v0.20.0"
    git push --follow-tags

The `release` workflow is started as soon as the tag makes it to GitHub. The
artifacts will start building right away and they will appear in the
[Releases page][release-github-page] as soon as they're ready.

The workflow runs are recorded by GitHub for auditing purposes, e.g. check out
the [workflow run][first-release-run] that made our very first release.
