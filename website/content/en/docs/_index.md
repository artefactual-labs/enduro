> Enduro brings endurance to Archivematica-based preservation workflows.

Enduro is a new application under development by Artefactual Systems. Originally created 
as a more stable replacement for Archivematicaâ€™s [automation-tools][automation-tools] 
library of scripts, it has since evolved into a flexible tool to be paired with 
preservation applications like [Archivematica][archivematica] to provide initial ingest 
activities such as content and structure validation, packaging, and more.

While still under development, Enduro is already being used in production at several large 
cultural heritage organizations. Enduro aims to cover our clients' needs while exploring 
new and innovative ways to build durable and fault-tolerant workflows suited for preservation. 
It is also a new space for experimentation and research to build a distributed system that 
enables users to run failure-oblivious and durable preservation workflows.
