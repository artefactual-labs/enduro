# Enduro

Enduro is a tool designed to automate the processing of transfers in multiple
Archivematica pipelines. It's part of a preservation solution that is being
used by the [National Health Archive (NHA)] and the [National Center for Truth
and Reconciliation (NCTR)].

It's a **proof of concept** at its very early stages. It aims to cover our
client's needs while exploring new and innovative ways to build durable and
fault-tolerant workflows suited for preservation.
