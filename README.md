# Enduro

Enduro is a new application under development by Artefactual Systems. Originally created 
as a more stable replacement for Archivematicaâ€™s [automation-tools][automation-tools] 
library of scripts, it has since evolved into a flexible tool to be paired with 
preservation applications like [Archivematica][archivematica] to provide initial ingest 
activities such as content and structure validation, packaging, and more.

While still under development, Enduro is already being used in production at several large 
cultural heritage organizations, including the [National Health Archive (NHA)] and the 
[National Center for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR)]. Enduro aims to cover our clients' 
needs while exploring new and innovative ways to build durable and fault-tolerant 
workflows suited for preservation. It is also a new space for experimentation and research 
to build a distributed system that enables users to run failure-oblivious and durable 
preservation workflows.
