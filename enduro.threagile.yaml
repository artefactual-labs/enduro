management_summary_comment: Threat model DFD for the Enduro SDPS (Secure Digital Preservation System)

business_criticality: critical

business_overview:
  description: The SDPS has an inherent goal of protecting the data that passes through during the AIP generation process. Data integrity and confidentiality ratings in the analysis reflect this.
  images:

technical_overview:
  description: SDPS is based around Temporal workflows which utilize a3m to generate AIPS. The system will run in a k8s based cluster such that AIP generation can scale up to meet user demands.
  images:

questions: # simply use "" as answer to signal "unanswered"
  Can GLUU be used to provide OIDC authentication in a k8s env?: Yes

abuse_cases:
  Denial-of-Service: >
    As a criminal I want to disturb the functionality of the backend system in order to cause indirect financial damage via unusable features.
  CPU-Cycle Theft: >
    As a criminal I want to steal CPU cycles in order to transform them into money via installed crypto currency miners.
  Ransomware: >
    As a criminal I want to encrypt the storage and file systems in order to demand ransom.
  Identity Theft: >
    As a criminal I want to steal identity data in order to reuse credentials and/or keys on other targets of the same company or outside.
  PII Theft: >
    As a criminal I want to steal PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data in order to blackmail the company and/or damage their repudiation by publishing the stolen data.

security_requirements:
  Input Validation: Strict input validation is required to reduce the overall attack surface.
  Encryption between containers: Communication between Docker containers must be protected with TLS encryption.
  Authentication: User must have an account to access the SDPS and it's data.
  EU-GDPR: Mandatory EU-GDPR # are there more of these we should know about?

individual_risk_categories:
# NOTE:
# For risk tracking each risk-id needs to be defined (the string with the @ sign in it). These unique risk IDs are visible in the PDF report (the small grey string under each risk), the Excel (column "ID"), as well as the JSON responses.
# Some risk IDs have only one @ sign in them, while others multiple. The idea is to allow for unique but still speaking IDs.
# Therefore each risk instance creates its individual ID by taking all affected elements causing the risk to be within an @-delimited part.
# Using wildcards (the * sign) for parts delimited by @ signs allows to handle groups of certain risks at once. Best is to lookup the IDs to use in the created Excel file. Alternatively a model macro "seed-risk-tracking" is available that helps in initially
# seeding the risk tracking part here based on already identified and not yet handled risks.
